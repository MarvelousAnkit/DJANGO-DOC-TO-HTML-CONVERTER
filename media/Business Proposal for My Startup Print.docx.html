<p><strong>Business Proposal for My Startup Print-F</strong></p>
<p><strong>Executive Summary:</strong></p>
<p>Print-f is a startup founded by a group of B. Tech CSE students from
Amity University Patna. We noticed the difficulties our peers were
facing when it came to printing out documents on campus, and we wanted
to provide a more convenient and hassle-free printing experience for
students. We have created a website that allows students to upload their
documents and have them delivered to their location within a minute,
providing instant and next-day delivery options. Our pricing model is
affordable and transparent, with a cost of 1 Rs per page. Pricing would
vary as per demand. Our goal is to revolutionize the printing industry
by providing a seamless and efficient service for students.</p>
